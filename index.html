        <p>Elsa was the queen of Arendelle before her sister Anna. Elsa has ice powers, she can create or destroy snow/ice .At first Elsa was afraid of the outside world because her parents warned her about it. But after coming outside the palace she understood the world very well and saved Arendelle for 2 times.<br>I like Elsa because she shown became a strong girl from an afraid one. </p>
